# DWaveHPLatticeProteins
This repository contains a version of the code implementing
the QUBO HP model for 2D square lattices as presented in the
publication

"Folding lattice proteins with quantum annealing" 
Anders Irb√§ck, Lucas Knuthson, Sandipan Mohanty, 
and Carsten Peterson 
Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043013

The code is based on a version developed by Lucas Knuthson
which was used to generate the data for the article. The
version in this repository has undergone some clean up
and reorganisation. In addition, some functions useful for
visualisation of our QUBO representation have been added
here.
